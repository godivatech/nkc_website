"Design a complete, fully responsive website for NKC Builders (https://nkcbuilders.in/), a premium Chennai-based construction company specializing in high-quality residential, commercial projects, interiors, and sustainable builds with a collaborative, design-forward approach. Create a modern, immersive architecture firm-style site: minimalist clean layout with generous white space, full-width hero sections featuring parallax scrolling videos or high-res images of construction sites/cranes/modern buildings, professional sans-serif typography (Montserrat bold for headings, Open Sans regular for body text at 16px base), color palette of deep navy blue (#001F3F) primary, warm concrete gray (#A9A9A9) neutrals, vibrant orange (#FF6B35) accents for CTAs/buttons, subtle gradients for depth. Ensure mobile-first responsive design (breakpoints: 320px mobile, 768px tablet, 1200px+ desktop), fast-loading optimized images (WebP format), SEO-optimized (semantic HTML5, alt texts, meta tags with keywords like 'Chennai builders', 'sustainable construction'), accessibility compliant (WCAG 2.1 AA: ARIA labels, 4.5:1 contrast, keyboard nav), smooth micro-interactions (fade-ins on scroll via Intersection Observer, hover scales on cards/buttons, testimonial slider with autoplay/dots).
